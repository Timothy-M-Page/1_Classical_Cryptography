# 1_Classical_Cryptography

This repository contains Python implementations of classical ciphers used before
the advent of modern computing.

Each program is designed to highlight the cryptographic principles behind these
ciphers. Please note that no emphasis has been placed on the practical utility
of these ciphers for secure encryption, as they are all obsolete by the
standards of modern cryptanalysis.
